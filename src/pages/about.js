      <p>I'm Charlie and this is my website!</p>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science student at Oregon State University.
        <br />
        <br />
        My background is related to the environmental field, where I initially
        became interested in programming while learning about Geographic
        Information Systems (GIS). This led me to pursue a second Bachelor's
        degree in Computer Science.
        <br />
        <br />
        My interests are focused on full stack development and I am currently
        looking for internship opportunities to expand on my technical skills.
